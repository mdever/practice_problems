-- Suppose you have a chain with infinitely many flat (i.e., one-dimensional) links.
-- The first link has length 1, and the length of each successive link is a fraction f 
-- of the previous linkâ€™s length. As you might expect, f is less than 1.
-- You place the chain flat on a table and some ink at the very end of the chain (i.e., the end with the infinitesimal links).
--
-- Initially, the chain forms a straight line segment, and the longest link is fixed in place. From there,
-- the links are constrained to move in a very specific way: The angle between each chain and the next,
-- smaller link is always the same throughout the chain. For example, if the Nth link and the N+1st link
-- form a 40 degree clockwise angle, then so do the N+1st link and the N+2nd link.
--
-- After you move the chain around as much as you can, what shape is drawn by the ink that was at the tail end of the chain?
